            Hello, My name is Ä°hsan, I am a Computer Engineering Student from Turkey.
            My hobbies are playing basketball, listening to music and learning about aviation industry.<br>
            <span id="extraText" style="display: none;">
            In programming-wise, I am interested in A.I. and Web Development.
            I started coding back in middle school as the outcome of my curiosity for how games were made. 
            Later, I started learning scratch and made couple of games with it. And then when I started
            learning C# and unfortunately I gave up before I got proefficient to create a proper game.
            Even though it was a great first step for my programming career.
            Still today, even though I haven't done anything about it, I still have plans for 
            doing something about game development in the future.
